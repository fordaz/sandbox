# RelMiner: Automated Knowledge Graph Extraction from Text

## Overview
RelMiner is an open-source command-line tool designed to automatically extract a knowledge graph from a given text corpus. It detects entities, concepts, and relationships within unstructured text, making it ideal for researchers, data scientists, and knowledge engineers looking to structure textual data.

RelMiner supports multiple input formats, including plain text, CSV, JSON, and HTML, and outputs structured graph data in formats such as RDF, JSON-LD, and CSV. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to accurately identify entities and relationships, providing a powerful foundation for downstream applications like semantic search, recommendation systems, and data integration.

## Installation
RelMiner requires Python 3.8+ and can be installed via pip:

```bash
pip install relminer
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and install it manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/example/relminer.git
cd relminer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage
### Basic Command
The simplest way to use RelMiner is by providing a text corpus as input:

```bash
relminer extract --input corpus.txt --output graph.json
```

This command extracts entities and relationships from `corpus.txt` and saves the knowledge graph in JSON format.

### Command-Line Options
#### `--input` (Required)
Specifies the input text file or directory containing multiple text files.

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input dataset/
```

#### `--output` (Required)
Defines the output file for the extracted knowledge graph. Supported formats include JSON (`.json`), RDF (`.rdf`), and CSV (`.csv`).

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input text.txt --output graph.rdf
```

#### `--format`
Specifies the output format (`json`, `rdf`, `csv`). Default is `json`.

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input data.txt --output graph.csv --format csv
```

#### `--language`
Allows processing of non-English text by specifying a language code (e.g., `en`, `es`, `de`). Default is `en`.

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input spanish_text.txt --output graph.json --language es
```

#### `--min-confidence`
Filters extracted relationships below a certain confidence threshold (0.0 to 1.0). Default is `0.5`.

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input data.txt --output graph.json --min-confidence 0.7
```

#### `--visualize`
Generates a visualization of the extracted knowledge graph as an HTML file.

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input corpus.txt --output graph.json --visualize
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### No Entities or Relationships Detected
- Ensure the input text is well-formed and contains sufficient named entities.
- Try lowering the `--min-confidence` threshold.
- Use the `--verbose` flag to get detailed logs on processing.

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input text.txt --output graph.json --verbose
```

### Output File is Empty
- Check if the specified output format is correct.
- Verify that the input file is not empty or incorrectly formatted.
- Use the `--debug` flag to diagnose issues.

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input dataset/ --output graph.json --debug
```

### Performance Issues
- If processing large corpora, consider increasing system memory or using batch processing.
- Use the `--threads` option to parallelize processing.

Example:
```bash
relminer extract --input large_data.txt --output graph.json --threads 4
```

---

## Best Practices
- Preprocess text by removing unnecessary punctuation and stopwords for better entity extraction.
- Use structured input formats (e.g., JSON) where possible for consistency.
- When working with multilingual text, specify the correct language using `--language`.
- Always review extracted relationships for accuracy before using the graph in critical applications.
